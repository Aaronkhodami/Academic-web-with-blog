# Academic Template (GitHub Pages)

This site is designed to deploy on GitHub Pages with the built-in Jekyll build.
No GitHub Actions needed.

## Quick deploy (beginner-friendly)

1) Fork this repository.
2) In your fork, open `_config.yml` and `_data/site.yml` and set:
   - `url: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
   - `baseurl: ""` (user/org site)
3) In GitHub, go to Settings -> Pages:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`), folder `/ (root)`
4) Commit and push. GitHub Pages will build and publish automatically.

## Editing content

- Home: `index.md`
- About: `about.md`
- Research: `research.md`
- Publications: `publications.md`
- Blog posts: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Local preview (optional)

If you want to preview locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Notes

- The `_site/` folder is generated by Jekyll and should not be committed.
- For project sites (username.github.io/repo), set `baseurl: "/REPO"`.
