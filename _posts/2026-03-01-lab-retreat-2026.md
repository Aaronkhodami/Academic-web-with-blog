Our group spent a weekend discussing ongoing projects, brainstorming future ideas, and taking time to connect outside the lab.

### Activities

*   **Brainstorming Sessions:** We dedicated mornings to deep dive discussions on new theoretical frameworks.
*   **Team Activities:** Afternoons were spent exploring the area.
*   **Evening Talks:** Informal talks over dinner sparked some of our best new ideas.

We came back energized and ready for the new semester!
