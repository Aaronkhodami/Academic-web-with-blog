This post explains how to fork, deploy, and customize the site. It also covers where to edit content, how to add images, and how to publish new posts.

## 1) Fork the repository

1. Click **Fork** on GitHub to copy the template into your account.
2. Open your forked repo.

Direct link to the repository:

https://github.com/Aaronkhodami/Academic-web-with-blog

## 2) Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings -> Pages**.
2. **Source:** Deploy from a branch.
3. **Branch:** `main` (or `master`), folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save and wait 1-3 minutes for the site to build.

### Set the URL and base URL

Open these files and edit the values:

- `_config.yml`
- `_data/site.yml`

If your site is a **project site** (username.github.io/repo), use:

```
url: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
baseurl: /YOUR_REPO
```

If your site is a **user/org site** (username.github.io), use:

```
url: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
baseurl: ""
```

Commit and push. GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically.

## 3) Update site identity

Edit `_data/site.yml` to replace the placeholder info:

- `title` and `description`
- `author.name`, `author.title`, `author.bio`
- `social` links
- `cv` file path

### Profile photo

1. Add your photo to `assets/images/`.
2. In `_data/site.yml`, set:

```
author:
	photo: your-photo.jpg
```

This image appears on the homepage and About page.

## 4) Update pages

Edit these Markdown files:

- Home: `index.md`
- About: `about.md`
- Research: `research.md`
- Publications: `publications.md`

## 5) Add and edit blog posts

Posts live in `_posts/` and must follow the naming format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

Each post has front matter at the top:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-02-10 10:00:00 +0100
categories: updates
tags: [News, Lab]
excerpt: "Short summary shown in the blog list."
---
```

## 6) How the blog list works

The blog list page lives at `blog.md`. It loops through `site.posts` and renders each post card.
When you add a new file in `_posts/`, it will automatically appear in the blog list.

If you want to change the blog layout or card design, edit `blog.md`.

## 7) How tags work

Tags come from each post's front matter:

```
tags: [News, Lab, Publication]
```

On the blog page, clicking a tag appends `?tag=YourTag` to the URL.
The blog page reads that parameter and shows only posts that include the tag.

If you want a post to appear under multiple topics, add more tags to its list.

## 8) SEO (search and social sharing)

The template uses `jekyll-seo-tag` and `jekyll-feed` (enabled in `_config.yml`).
SEO data comes from the site and page front matter.

To improve SEO and sharing previews:

- Set `title` and `description` in `_config.yml` and `_data/site.yml`.
- Ensure each page has a clear title.
- For posts or pages, add a custom image in the front matter if needed:

```
image: /assets/images/your-share-image.jpg
```

The default layout will use this image for social previews when available.
If no image is provided, it falls back to the profile photo from `_data/site.yml`.

## 9) Update publications

Edit `_data/publications.yml` to add or update entries. Each item supports:

- `title`, `type`, `authors`, `journal`, `abstract`
- `doi` (optional)
- `pdf` (local file or external link)

## 10) Update research interests

Edit `_data/interests.yml` to change the cards on the homepage.

## 11) Add images

Place images in `assets/images/` and reference them like this:

```
![Alt text]({{ '/assets/images/your-image.jpg' | relative_url }})
```

For your profile image, place the file in `assets/images/` and set `author.photo` in `_data/site.yml`.

## 12) Update technical skills (tools)

The **Technical Skills** section is driven by `_data/about.yml`:

```
tools:
	- Python
	- R
	- MATLAB
```

### Add tool icons (custom)

You can use any image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG).

1. Upload icon files to `assets/images/`.
2. Edit `_data/icons.yml` to map tool names to icon files. Example:

```
python: python.png
matlab: matlab.svg
r: r.png
```

3. Make sure the tool name in `_data/about.yml` matches the key (case-insensitive).

The template lowercases the tool name to find the icon key.
If no icon is found, it tries `toolname.png` automatically.

## 13) Add education entries and logos

Education entries live in `_data/about.yml`:

```
education:
	- degree: Ph.D. in [Field]
		university: "[University Name]"
		logo: "university_logo.png"
		url: "https://university.edu"
		year: "[Year]"
		details: |
			Dissertation: "[Your dissertation title here]"<br>
			Advisors: [Advisor names]
```

### Add an education logo

1. Upload the logo file to `assets/images/`.
2. Set `logo` to the file name (for example, `university_logo.png`).

The logo will appear next to the university name on the About page.

## 14) Add experience entries and logos

Experience entries are also in `_data/about.yml`:

```
experience:
	- position: "Current Position"
		institution: "[Institution Name]"
		logo: "company_logo.png"
		url: "https://example.com"
		duration: "[Start Year - Present]"
		description: "[Key responsibility or achievement]"
```

Upload logos to `assets/images/` and set the `logo` file name just like education.

## 15) Update contact and social links

Contact and social links are in `_data/site.yml` under `social`:

```
social:
	email: your-email@domain.com
	linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/username
	x_twitter: https://x.com/username
	google_scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Example
	researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/username
	orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000
	website: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
```

Replace each link with your real profile URL. Leave any field blank if you do not want it shown.

The email is used in the About page contact section. Update it here:

```
social:
	email: your-email@domain.com
```

## 16) Add a Google Map to the contact section

The map appears on the About page in the Contact section. To set it:

1. Go to Google Maps and search for your address.
2. Click **Share** -> **Embed a map**.
3. Copy the iframe URL from the embed code.
	 - It looks like `https://www.google.com/maps/embed?...`
4. Paste that URL into `_data/about.yml` under `contact.map`:

```
contact:
	office: |
		[Building Name], Room [Number]<br>
		[Institution Name]
	map: "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=..."
```

If you leave `map` empty, the template shows a "Map not configured" message.

## 17) Troubleshooting

- **CSS missing or broken layout:** Check `baseurl` is correct.
- **Page not updating:** Wait 1-3 minutes after pushing changes.
- **404 on assets:** Ensure file paths match and use `relative_url`.

If you follow these steps, your site will deploy cleanly and be easy to maintain.
