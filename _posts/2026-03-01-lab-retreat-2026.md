The entire lab spent a wonderful weekend in the Dolomites discussing ongoing projects, brainstorming future ideas, and hiking through some of the most beautiful landscapes in Italy.

### Activities

*   **Brainstorming Sessions:** We dedicated mornings to deep dive discussions on new theoretical frameworks.
*   **Hiking:** Afternoons were spent exploring the trails.
*   **Evening Talks:** Informal talks over dinner sparked some of our best new ideas.

We came back energized and ready for the new semester!
