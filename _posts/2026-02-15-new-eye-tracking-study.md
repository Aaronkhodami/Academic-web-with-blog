We are pleased to announce our latest study on peripheral vision and attention has been published in the *Journal of Vision*. This work challenges existing models of how we allocate attention in cluttered environments.

### Key Findings

1.  Peripheral vision is not merely a blurred version of central vision.
2.  Attention can be allocated to feature-based object representations even in the far periphery.
3.  Our computational model predicts human performance with 95% accuracy.

### Future Directions

We are now extending this work to dynamic scenes to understand how these mechanisms operate in real-world environments like driving or sports.
